# Spotify Friend Activity

This program serves a web client that calls a backend proxy on your server which talks to Spotify's unofficial activity API and displays it in a webpage with similar styling to Spotify.

Todo:

- [ ] Cache API results in backend
- [ ] Add last listened time to frontend
- [ ] Save history to DB and allow seeing past activity?
- [ ] Github Actions to build Docker image
